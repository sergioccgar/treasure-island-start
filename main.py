With each stroke you give, the farther the shore seems. A little light starts shining and moving under you, beneath the still waves. It dances and reaches your feet. At first it tickles, but then a burning sensation starts eating away your flesh by melting it. The pain is unbearable. As your body slowly melts away you start getting closer to the shore.
